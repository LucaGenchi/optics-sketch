        <p>Laser technology occupies a central position within photonics because laser
        light exhibits several properties that distinguish it from conventional light
        sources, beyond simple monochromaticity. A laser beam is characterized by high
        spatial coherence, which permits propagation over considerable distances with
        minimal divergence — frequently limited only by diffraction — and allows the beam
        to be focused to a very small spot, yielding a correspondingly high intensity.</p>
        <p>This coherence typically extends to the temporal domain as well: most lasers
        emit within a very narrow spectral bandwidth, in contrast to sources such as
        incandescent or gas-discharge lamps, which radiate across a broad spectral range.
        An exception exists among ultrafast lasers, several of which are inherently
        broadband, since a sufficiently short pulse duration necessarily corresponds to a
        correspondingly broad frequency spectrum.</p>
        <p>Laser emission may be continuous or pulsed, with pulse durations ranging from
        microseconds down to a few femtoseconds. Concentrating a given pulse energy into a
        shorter duration — in addition to spatial concentration at a focus — enables
        substantially higher intensities than continuous-wave operation can achieve; the
        most extreme intensities produced this way are employed in high-field physics.</p>
        <p>The theoretical foundation for the laser predates its experimental realization:
        Townes, Schawlow, Basov, and Prokhorov independently developed the theory of
        stimulated emission as a mechanism for light amplification, building on the
        microwave maser Townes had demonstrated in 1953 — the concept was initially termed
        the "optical maser" before "laser" became standard usage. Theodore Maiman first
        realized this theory experimentally in 1960, constructing the first laser: a
        pulsed, lamp-pumped ruby crystal. The same year saw two further milestones: the
        helium–neon laser, the first to operate with a gaseous gain medium, and the first
        semiconductor laser diode.</p>
        <p>Real laser beams are not perfectly collimated: they exhibit Gaussian
        propagation and diverge with distance. For a beam of waist radius
        <span class="w">w₀</span>, the far-field half-angle divergence is given by</p>`,

        <p>These properties originate from stimulated emission within a resonant cavity:
        a gain medium bounded by two mirrors amplifies a specific wavelength on each round
        trip, while losses — mirror transmission, absorption, scattering — deplete it.
        Above threshold, the pump rate at which round-trip gain first equals round-trip
        loss, the cavity sustains the stable, highly monochromatic, spatially coherent
        beam described above.</p>`,

        rather than a single infinitesimal ray that can never miss an aperture.</p>

        aperture <span class="w">NA</span> is the single number that matters most: it
        sets the objective's light-gathering cone and, through diffraction, the finest

      html2: `
        <p>Modern objectives are almost always <strong>infinity-corrected</strong>: a
        point at the sample (the front focal plane) emits a cone that leaves the back of
        the objective as a <em>collimated</em> beam, which a separate tube lens then
        focuses onto a camera or eyepiece — nothing focuses light directly behind an
        infinity objective on its own. The reference plane a focal length
        <span class="w">f</span> behind the objective, on that tube-lens side, is the
        <strong>back focal plane (BFP)</strong> — where the objective's entrance pupil
        (radius above) is imaged. It matters most in laser-scanning microscopy: a scan
        mirror, or its relayed image via a scan lens and tube lens, is deliberately
        positioned at a plane conjugate to the BFP, so that as the mirror tilts, the beam
        pivots around a fixed point inside the pupil instead of walking across it —
        keeping the full aperture illuminated at every scan angle.</p>
        <p>That same magnification formula is also why widefield imaging systems pick
        the objective focal length they do. A high-power compound-microscope objective
        (60×, 100×) has a very short focal length — often just a couple of millimeters —
        paired with a long tube lens, and trades that magnification for a short working
        distance and a narrow field of view. A <strong>stereomicroscope</strong> sits at
        the opposite end on purpose: its objective (shared or paired, one per eye) has a
        comparatively long focal length, giving low-to-moderate magnification, a wide
        field of view, and — critically for a dissecting scope — enough physical working
        distance to actually get hands or tools under the lens. Zoom stereomicroscopes
        vary magnification with a separate afocal zoom system in between, but the same
        rule holds at any zoom setting: a shorter effective objective focal length always
        means higher magnification and a smaller field of view, at the cost of working
        distance.</p>`,
